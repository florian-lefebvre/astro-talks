Astro components are the basic building blocks of any Astro project. They are HTML-only templating components with <span class="text-gradient">**no client-side runtime**</span> and use the `.astro` file extension.

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. The syntax was designed to feel familiar to anyone with experience writing HTML or JSX, and adds support for including components and JavaScript expressions.
