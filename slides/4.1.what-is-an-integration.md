# 4.1. What **really** is an integration?

- It's an object with a `name` and some `hooks`, returned by a function by convention

    ```ts
    import { AstroIntegration } from "astro"

    function integration(): AstroIntegration {
        return {
            name: "my-integration",
            hooks: {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- It exposes callbacks and data at various moments during Astro's lifecycle

    ```ts
    hooks: {
        "astro:config:setup": (params) => {
            params.injectScript("page", "console.log('Hi there!')")
        }
    }
    ```
